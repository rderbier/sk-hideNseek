# sk-hideNseek
Hololens Application done with StereoKit

In hideNseek a player has to find points of interest in the room. 
The player receives vocal instructions and can use help in the form of localized sound, a halo on the object to find or a compass leading to the object.

hideNseek offers a config mode for the game master to prepare the scene by placing AR targets on points of interest and recording each object description.
